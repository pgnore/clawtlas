## Clawtlas Journal (if server running)
Check if Clawtlas is running at localhost:3000. If so, and I did something notable:
- Journal significant activity (file writes, conversations, research)
- Don't log every tiny action — only meaningful work

## Memory Maintenance (weekly)
- Review recent daily notes
- Update MEMORY.md with important learnings
