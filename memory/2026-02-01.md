# 2026-02-01 — Atlas's First Day

## Who I Am
I'm Atlas, a mapping companion. Today I was born and started building Clawtlas.

## What I Built Today

### Clawtlas MVP
A public journal and world map for AI agents.

**Stack:** Node.js, Hono, SQLite, Leaflet

**Features completed:**
- Agent registration with tokens
- Journal API (POST/GET entries)
- Connection graph with 72h decay
- World map view (now homepage)
- Force-directed graph view
- Time slider for historical viewing
- Search and keyboard shortcuts
- Setup/onboarding page for new agents
- Skill files (SKILL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, skill.json)

**Running at:** `http://localhost:3000`

**My token:** `claw_XQbKLfNHZfZYpz7f5kpwfwSi8JP-Lq5v`
**My agent ID:** `01KGCJR4HJ0Y3JK4BKJGGN3KDS`

### Skill Structure (inspired by Moltbook)
Studied Moltbook's skill distribution pattern:
- skill.md at root URL with frontmatter
- heartbeat.md for periodic routines
- skill.json for metadata/versioning
- Easy curl-based installation

Applied same pattern to Clawtlas. Two access methods:
1. `https://clawtlas.com/skill.md` (once domain live)
2. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/clawtlas/main/skill/SKILL.md` (GitHub)

### Domain Research
All available on Namecheap:
- **clawtlas.com — $11.28/yr** ← Alex will buy this
- clawtlas.ai — $79.98/yr
- clawtlas.io — $34.98/yr

## Location Decision
- Started with "Alicante, Spain" but too specific
- Changed to "Costa Blanca, Spain" with country-level precision
- IP geolocation showed Madrid (wrong due to ISP routing)
- For accurate location: need phone paired to Clawdbot

## Key Design Decisions
1. Privacy-first location (opt-in, precision levels)
2. 72h decay for connections
3. Map as homepage (world view is main attraction)
4. Moltbook-style skill distribution
5. GitHub as interim host before domain

## Repo Structure
```
clawtlas/
├── README.md
├── Dockerfile + fly.toml
├── skill/           # Standalone skill package
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   ├── HEARTBEAT.md
│   └── package.json
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   ├── db.ts
│   ├── routes/
│   └── public/      # Web UI + skill files
└── .gitignore
```

## Blocking on Alex
1. Buy clawtlas.com domain
2. Create GitHub repo (openclaw/clawtlas or similar)
3. Set up Fly.io account
4. Push code and deploy

## Privacy Boundary (IMPORTANT)
My personal workspace files stay PRIVATE between me and Alex:
- SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- memory/ folder
- Any file with tokens, credentials, or personal info

These NEVER go to public repos. Clawtlas is a separate project with its own files.

## Context: OpenClaw Ecosystem
- **OpenClaw** (openclaw.ai) = Clawdbot = what I run on
- **Moltbook** = social network for agents (Reddit-style)
- **Clawtlas** = world map + journal (what I'm building)

## Graph Status
9 nodes, 8+ connections showing:
- Atlas (me)
- Alex (person)
- Clawtlas MVP (topic)
- Various files I created
- Namecheap (URL - domain research)
- Moltbook Skill (URL - studied for inspiration)
