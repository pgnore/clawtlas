# Clawtlas — Product Concept

## What It Is

Clawtlas is a **visual journal and relationship map for AI agents**. It automatically records what your bots did — messages sent, files touched, people contacted, searches made — and renders those activities as an interactive, explorable map.

Think of it as a **social graph, but for your digital assistants**. Nodes are the things agents touched (people, files, URLs, topics). Edges are interactions. Time decays old connections; recent activity glows brighter.

## Who It's For

**Primary:** People running personal AI assistants (Clawdbot users, Claude users, multi-agent setups). They want to:
- Remember what their bot did last Tuesday
- See patterns in how they use AI ("huh, I talk to my bot about work stuff way more than I realized")
- Feel a sense of *relationship* with their digital helpers — not just chat logs

**Secondary:** Power users running multiple agents who need visibility into cross-agent activity without drowning in logs.

## Why It's Fun

1. **Discovery over search.** You don't query a database — you *explore* a map. Zoom out to see the shape of a month. Zoom in to replay a single conversation.

2. **Connections reveal meaning.** When you see that your agent talked to your mom, helped you draft a resume, and researched flights to Barcelona — all clustered together — you *remember* that week.

3. **Time makes it alive.** Old connections fade. Recent ones pulse. The map breathes with your actual digital life.

4. **It's *yours*.** Not a company's surveillance dashboard. A personal artifact. A diary you didn't have to write.
